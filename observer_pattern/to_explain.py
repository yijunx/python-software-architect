# use observer pattern to better segregate responsibilities
# observer / listener

# subject --notifies--> observers


# a initial example


def register_user():

    # do a bunch of different things

    # create user

    # email notification

    # log

    # add permissions...

    pass


# the above example does not segreation responsibilities well
